## Introduction

Recommender systems play a crucial role in helping users navigate the vast selection of movies on streaming platforms. However, these systems often operate as "black boxes," providing little insight into why certain recommendations are made. This research leverages XAI techniques such as Feature Importance and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to enhance the explainability of collaborative filtering-based movie recommendations.

## Research Overview

- **Objective**: To improve the transparency and user trust in movie recommendation systems using XAI.
- **Approach**: We utilize two XAI methods:
  - **Feature Importance**: Identifies the key features (e.g., genre, director) influencing recommendations.
  - **LIME**: Provides user-specific explanations for individual recommendations.
- **Dataset**: MovieLens 20M dataset, containing approximately 20 million movie ratings from over 138,000 users.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)

## Installation

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saipavanD27/Movies-Recommendation-System.git
## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially to train the collaborative filtering model and generate explanations using XAI techniques.
2. Modify the parameters in the code to experiment with different settings and analyze the results.

## Dataset

We used the MovieLens 20M dataset for training and evaluation. The dataset includes:

1. 20 million ratings across 27,278 movies
2. User-movie interaction data useful for building and testing recommendation systems

## Results

Our experiments demonstrate that XAI techniques can significantly improve the transparency of collaborative filtering recommendations:

1. Feature Importance analysis reveals that features like genre and director are major influencers of recommendations.
2. LIME provides user-centric explanations, highlighting specific reasons behind individual movie suggestions.
These insights foster user trust and engagement, enhancing the overall experience of using movie recommendation systems.

## Future Work

- **Expand Feature Set**: Explore additional features such as critical reception or cast popularity to improve recommendation accuracy.
-  **Advanced XAI Techniques**: Investigate other explainability methods to provide more comprehensive explanations.
- **User Studies**: Conduct user studies to validate the effectiveness of explanations in real-world settings.
